# Sw.SampleWebProject

There are two scripts available that will build and publish this project from the command line.
They are windows batch files that execute powershell and MSBuild scripts.

## build.cmd

Run the build script with the pre-authenticated MyGet URL parameter. e.g.

```
build.cmd https://www.myget.org/F/elite/auth/{secrect}/api/v3/index.json
```

This will tell the nuget client how to authenticate with our private feed, 
restore packages from the office nuget.org feed and our private feed,
and build the project with MSBuild.

## publish.cmd

Run the publish script with the following parameters:

1. Project Name: the name of the project. The script uses this to build the path to the web .csproj file. 
  E.g. if you use `Sw.SampleWebProject` as the ProjectName, it will know that the project file is `Sw.SampleWebProject\Sw.SampleWebProject.csproj`.
2. Web Server: the name of the server with IIS and MS Web Deploy that you are deploying to. This can be an IP address, server name, or domain name.
3. IIS path: the deploy path in IIS. It's usually `"Default Web Site/ProjectName"`
4. Build Configuration: for test environments, this is typically Debug, for live environments Release.

```
publish.cmd Sw.SampleWebProject localhost "Default Web Site/SampleWebProject"  Debug    
```
